# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
This analysis examines variables of vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, all wheel drive (AWD) and miles per gallon (mpg). It uses R to design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. An R^2 of .7149 indicates that the model explains 71% of mpg predictions. The p-value of 5.35e-11 also suggests the results are not due to chance. The vehicle length and ground clearance statistically impact mpg. Coversely, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD produced only random variance.
